# Topic
Our group chose to analzye 5 different cryptocurrencies with the goal of comparing their previous growth and tracking their trajectory in oder to see which would be the lucrative value to invest in. We chose to go with this topic because crypto is a modern market that many know about but not many have the information to understand its value. The question we hope to answer is to see which currency would be the best value for a customer. The 5 we choose were: Bitcoin, DogeCoin Tether, Etherium, and XRP.
