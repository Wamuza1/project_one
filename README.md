 # Topic
  
    Our group choose to analzye 5 different cryptocurrencies with the goal of comparing their previous growth and tracking their trajectory in oder to
    see which would be the lucrative value to invest in. We choose to go with this because crypto is a modern market that many know about but not many
    have the information to understand its value. The question we hope to answer is to see which currency would be the best value for a customer. The 5 we choose
    were:
    
        Bitcoin; DogeCoin; Tether; Etherium; XRP 



# Github Management

 any questions or issues that could arise when commiting the files. Our communication as a group relies on using Slack as 
 a resource in oder to have on consise area where we can post and keep track of our progress.
